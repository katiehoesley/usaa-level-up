# Data Structures in Java



## Arrays
Arrays are a data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. Elements can be accessed using indexes.


## ArrayList 
This class uses dynamic arrays for stories elements, and arrays are sequentially arranged in the memory. It implements the List interface.

## Lists 


## HashMaps
A HashMap is used to store key-value pairs. It implements the Map interface and is not a part of the collection. 

HashMap using the hashing technique to store key-value pairs. The key-value pair is called a **bucket**. Each bucket is stored in an array in the HashMap class. The hashing function works on the key and returns an index at which the bucket is stored. 

There are chances of two keys returning the same index upon hashing. In such cases, the buckets are stored at the same index but are linked, the same as in a Linked List. 

HashMap contains two basic methods: `get` and `put`, to get the value and put the key-value pair in the map.
